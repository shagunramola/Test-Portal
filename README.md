# Test-Portal
A web based project to host online tests

The basic idea is to create a website where schools and universities can register themselves and create and conduct online multiple choice tests for its students.

In the website one can request for registration of their institute upon approval of which a profile for the institue is created where they can register multiple admins who in return and register students of their institue.
